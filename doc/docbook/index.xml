	TkGate is a graphical editor and&nbsp; event-driven simulator for digital
circuits with a tcl/tk-based interface.&nbsp; Supported circuit elements
include basic gates (AND, OR, etc.), tri-state gates, adders, multipliers,
registers, memories and mos transistors.&nbsp; Hierarchical design is also
supported with support for user defined modules.&nbsp; Save files are based
on the Verilog netlist format.

	<title>Introduction to TkGate</title>
	<para>TkGate is a digital circuit editor and simulator with a Tcl/Tk-based
interface.  TkGate includes a large number of built-in devices
including basic gates, memories, ttys and modules for hierarchical
design.  The simulator can be controlled either interactively or
through a simulation script.  Memory contents can be loaded from
files, and a microcode/macrocode compiler (gmac) is included to create
TkGate memory files from a high-level description.  The simulator
supports continuous simulation, single step simulation (by clock or
epoch) and breakpoints.  Save files are in a Verilog-like format.
	</para>
	<para>
A TkGate circuit is divided into one or more modules, with one of the
modules being designated the "top-level" or "root" module.  A module
is composed of zero or more "gates" and wires to connect the gates.
We use the term "gate" loosely to refer to any circuit element.
Special "comment" gates can be used to place text in the circuit.
	</para>
	<para>
Creating a gate in TkGate is simply a matter of clicking the cursor to
set a position, and selecting a gate type from the menu.  Since most
gate types have a one or two character shortcut, once you learn the
shortcuts you can perform most of your editing with one hand on the
keyboard and the other hand on the mouse.  Moving gates is almost as
easy as creating them, simply select a gate (or gates) and drag them
to a new position, any wires connected to the gates will be moved
along with them and adjusted to ensure that they contain only
horizontal and vertical segments.
