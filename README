TkGate 2.0 Release notes.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

SAVE FILE DIFFERENCES WITH PAST VERSIONS

2.0-b5 and earlier
   The DEMUX device was redesigned in 2.0-b5.  When reading earlier save files,
   any instance of DEMUX are translated to OLDDEMUX which have the original
   definition.

1.8.x and earlier
   Substantial changes in save file format were made in the transition from
   1.8.x to 2.0.  The new format is expected to be compliant with 3rd party
   verilog tools.  TkGate 2.0 can read files from earlier versions of tkgate
   but can only write 2.0 format files which will be unreadable by earlier
   versions of tkgate.

1.6h and earlier
   These versions do not support the "extender bar" style of basic gates.  Files
   saved by later versions may either not load properly, or may have input wires
   in odd places when loaded under old versions of tkgate.

1.5c and earlier
   Positions of wire "tap" elements have changed slightly due to the new method
   for drawing buses.  When reading old files, the positions will be slightly
   modified to fit the new scheme, but if you save the file, wire positions will
   be slightly off when rereading from an old version of tkgate.

   Basic flip-flop elements do not exist in this version and lower.

1.4c and earlier
   Multi-technology delay specification, and per-gate delay specification is
   not supported.  If any delays other than "default" are used, the file may
   not be readable by older versions of tkgate.

MULTI-LINGUAL SUPPORT

1. JAPANESE

As of TkGate 2.0, Japanese support is automatically compiled in.  To use
it, run tkgate with the -Lja option, or make sure your LANG environment
variable is set to a Japanese locale (e.g., ja_JP.eucJP).  Attempting to
run TkGate with an invalid locality value could cause it to core dump
in the tcl/tk initialization routines.  You must also set up kanji
conversion and input servers in order to input Japanese.  Currently,
Japanese is only supported in comments and "frames".

There are many ways of configuring kanji conversion and input servers,
so I will not go into all of them here.  I have tested tkgate with
canna.  Make the following changes to enable Japanese input:

In .xinitrc:

   kinput2 -canna -xim&

In .cshrc:

   setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=kinput2"

To enter switch between English input and Japanese input use the
command <shift-space>.  While Japanese messages are enabled for any
locale name that starts with "ja", the locale must be set to "ja_JP.eucJP"
in order to enable Japanese input.  Using the '-Lja' switch will also
ensure that the environment variables are set correctly.

2. RUSSIAN

Russian locale uses 'koi8-r' single-byte encoding for the circuit comment
text. In order to display in-circuit cyrillic text, the X fonts packages,
containing 'helvetica' and 'courier' family koi8-r encoded fonts should
be installed.
